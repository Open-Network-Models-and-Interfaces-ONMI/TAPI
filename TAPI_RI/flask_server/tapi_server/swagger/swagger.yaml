      \ two or more FcPorts that provide alternative identical inputs/outputs), the\
      \ FC will have one or more associated FcSwitch objects to represent the alternative\
      \ flow choices visible at the edge of the FC.\nThe FC switch represents and\
      \ defines a protection switch structure encapsulated in the FC. \nEssentially\
      \ performs one of the functions of the Protection Group in a traditional model.\
      \ It associates to 2 or more FcPorts each playing the role of a Protection Unit.\
      \ \nOne or more protection, i.e. standby/backup, FcPorts provide protection\
      \ for one or more working (i.e. regular/main/preferred) FcPorts where either\
      \ protection or working can feed one or more protected FcPort.\nThe switch may\
      \ be used in revertive or non-revertive (symmetric) mode. When in revertive\
      \ mode it may define a waitToRestore time.\nIt may be used in one of several\
      \ modes including source switch, destination switched, source and destination\
      \ switched etc (covering cases such as 1+1 and 1:1).\nIt may be locked out (prevented\
      \ from switching), force switched or manual switched.\nIt will indicate switch\
      \ state and change of state.\nThe switch can be switched away from all sources\
      \ such that it becomes open and hence two coordinated switches can both feed\
      \ the same LTP so long as at least one of the two is switched away from all\
      \ sources (is 'open').\nThe ability for a Switch to be 'high impedance' allows\
      \ bidirectional ForwardingConstructs to be overlaid on the same bidirectional\
      \ LTP where the appropriate control is enabled to prevent signal conflict.\n\
