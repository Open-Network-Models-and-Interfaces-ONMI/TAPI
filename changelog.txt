    All diagrams/all modules: sanitised r/w attributes, alignment to grid.
    
    - TapiCommon: added profileType to Profile. TapiPhotonic, TapiTopology,
    TapiOam: distributed profile type enumeration.
    - TapiCommon: added photonic PM metrics to pm identity.
    - TapiTopology: Link, Node, NEP: the reference to adminPac is now
    read/write, not reflected in yang as it is translated with “uses”
    statement (extended composite).
    - TapiConnectivity: _selectedConnectionEndPoint and _selectedRoute of
    switch are now 0..* instead of wrong 1..*
    - TapiConnectivity: ResilienceConstraint, deprecated isLockout and made
    optional [0..1] faultConditionDetermination and isFrozen and
    isCoordinatedSwitchingBothEnds and selectionControl.
    - TapiConnectivity: selectionReason comment now is “No reason to affect
    selection.” and selectionControl comment now is “Remove of any previous
    administrative command (CLEAR) or no administrative command currently
    applied.”
    - TapiConnectivity: SwitchControl and Switch all read only.
    - TapiConnectivity: added ConnectivityProtectionService which augments
    ConnectivityService, plus SwitchOperation which refers to SwitchControl
    and Switch.
    - TapiPhotonic: added new identity PhotonicOamJobType, added new diagram
    PhotonicPm with PhotonicPerformanceData class augmenting CD and HD.
    - TapiPhotonic: added OtsiMonitoringPac to OtsiTerminationPac and to
    PhotonicPerformanceData.
    - TapiOam: added thrsAdditionalQualifier to the ThresholdConfig
    datatype.
    - TapiPhotonic: PhotThrsAddQualif augments ThrsAddQualif.
    - TapiPhotonic: added CommonExplicit and CommonOrganizationalExplicit to
    OtsiConfigPac for the direct provisioning of all transceiver parameters.

    Corrections to photonic media and equipment
    
    Changes made to equipment UML and photonic media UML in previous pushes (today) were not applied correctly to the YANG. These have now been applied (including move of geolocation).
    
    The following changes have been made:
    - Removed ExperimentalConcrete and ExperimentalAbstract from the UML (not in YANG)
    - Description added to amplification-config "This structure is for further development and is NOT used in this version." in both UML and YANG.
    - Description added to otsi-routing-spec "This structure is for further development and is NOT used in this version." in both UML and YANG.
    - Description added to regen-metric "This structure is for further development and is NOT used in this version." in the UML. This structure is NOT in the YANG yet.
    - ots-media-connection-end-point-spec augment relationship added to UML diagram (model was correct).
    - first-of-chain in amplification set to config false (and read only true).
    - generalizedSnr in uml made 0..1 (no change necessary to YANG).
    - comment on ingress direction of oms general optical params in both UML and YANG improved and aligned with the RIA.
    - comment on ingress direction of ots impairments in both UML and YANG improved and aligned with the RIA.

    power measurements.
    - TapiPhotonic: removed the OtsiMcPropertiesPac, in case the frequency
    info is necessary in DWDM then OTSiMC layer shall be foreseen. By
    definition, the frequency of an OTSiMC is in the center of its spectrum.
    - TapiPhotonic: removed comment “mc config and mc bw config mutually
    exclusive” from service diagram.
    - TapiPhotonic, some labels modified (organiz –> organizational, removed
    “profile” suffix from ancillary structures of profiles).

    replaces the currently defined RoadmAddPath, RoadmDropPath and
    RoadmExpressPath, with the superset of all their attributes.
    - TapiPhotonic: A single profile, named AmplificationProfile, replaces
    the currently defined FixedGainAmplification and
    VariableGainAmplification.
    - TapiPhotonic: all frequencies in Hz (comments).

    Several modifications, see below for details.
    
    Note: Yang/Tree not updated for Streaming and Equipment.
    
    1.      Added the missing augments to EventNotification Signal (TapiTopology,
    TapiConnectivity, TapiOam, TapiNotification, TapiPathComputation,
    TapiVirtualNetwork).
    2.      TapiCommon: centralized the PmParamName and AlarmName enums, based on
    Detected enum. This allows to have TapiFm and TapiOam independency.
    3.      TapiTopology: NRGAggregatesNEP becomes navigable in both directions.
    4.      TapiTopology: ForwardingRule becomes identity (is leaf = false).
    5.      TapiTopology: NodeRuleGroup may refer to zero NEPs, previously was at
    least 1. (not translated, removed from yang the manual min-elements).
    6.      TapiTopology: Rule now references the Profile.
    7.      TapiConnectivity: ConnectivityService, the direction was wrongly
    readonly.
    8.      TapiPhotonic: otherProperties (name-value pairs) added to
    CommonExplicit of TransceiverExplicitProfile.
    9.      TapiPhotonic: OtsImpairments is now composed by OtsMediaCepSpec, no
    longer by OtsNodeEdgePointSpec.
    10.     TapiPhotonic: OtsiConnectionEndPointSpec deleted. Added to
    OtsiMcConnectionEndPointSpec the composition to OtsiTerminationPac.
    11.     TapiPhotonic: OtsiMcPropertiesPac, remains only the central
    frequency.
    12.     TapiPhotonic: deleted the physical-cep-pac.
    13.     TapiPhotonic: OtsiTerminationPac, selectedCentralFrequency now
    megahertz and integer, and corrected typo transmited – transmittedPower,
    selectedSpectrum is now of FrequencyRange simple type.
    14.     TapiPhotonic: McCepHasOtsiMcPac from [1..*] to [0..*].
    15.     TapiPhotonic: TransceiverProfile inserted between Profile and the 3
    specific transceiver profiles.
    16.     TapiPhotonic: RoadmPathProfile inserted between Profile and the 2
    specific roadm path profiles.
    17.     TapiPhotonic: new RoadmForwardingRule augmenting
    TapiTopology:ForwardingRule.
    18.     TapiPhotonic: all frequency types are integer, specified in MHz.
    19.     TapiPhotonic: deleted OtsiServiceInterfacePointSpec and
    OtsiCapabilityPac, MediaChannelServiceInterfacePointSpec renamed as
    PhotonicMediaServiceInterfacePointSpec, TotalPowerThresholdPac and
    PowerManagementCapabilityPac include now frequencyRange and both are
    composed [0..*] by PhotonicMediaServiceInterfacePointSpec.
    20.     TapiPhotonic: deleted media-channel-node-edge-point-spec, replaced
    by photonic-media-node-edge-point-spec, which includes
    total-power-threshold-pac and power-management-capability-pac.
    21.     TapiPhotonic: deleted OtsiConnectivityServiceEndPointSpec,
    MediaChannelConnectivityServiceEndPointSpec,
    OtsiMcConnectivityServiceEndPointSpec.
    22.     TapiPhotonic: deleted MediaChannelConnectionEndPointSpec, renamed
    all previously children classes. Now there are 4 augments of the CEP
    (OtsMedia, Oms, Mc, OtsiMc specs) all composing PowerMeasurementPac and
    SpectrumPac. The OtsiResourceSpec diagram has been removed, adding the
    OtsiTerminationPac to McResourceSpec diagram and removing the
    OtsiNodeEdgePointSpec.
    23.     TapiPhotonic: deleted the augment McgCsepSpecAugmentsCsep, deleted
    OtsNodeEdgePointSpec.
    24.     TapiPhotonic: deleted the McNepHasOmsGeneralOptParams, now the
    OmsGeneralOpticalParams are composed by OmsConnectionEndPointSpec.
    25.     TapiPhotonic: in frequencyConstraint, the adjustmentGranularity and
    gridType are now [0..1]. Removed UNSPECIFIED from gridType.
    AdjustmentGranularity and GridType from ENUM to Identity (Is Leaf
    false).
    26.     TapiPhotonic: made [0..1] almost all impairment items.
    27.     TapiPhotonic: renamed OtsiaCsepTtpPac as OtsiaCsepTtpSpec.

    added the augment to HistoryData from delayCounter.
    32.     TapiDigitalOtn: introduced OtnOamService between augmented
    OamService and OduTcmOamService, introduced OtnMegSpec between augmented
    Meg and OduTcmMeg, OduCnCsepTtpPac no longer augmenting
    LayerProtocolConstraint, now composed by
    OduConnectivityServiceEndPointSpec.
    33.     TapiNotification: EventNotification, added the additionalInfo.
    34.     TapiNotification: added targetObjectDri to EventNotification.
    35.     TapiNotification: added Profile augmenting EventNotification (and
    Signal).
    36.     TapiFm: FmNotificationType is now simply “Fm” to shorten the final
    identities.
    37.     TapiOam: CurrentData, elapsedTime is now optional 0..1, added
    oamJobState to OamJob.
    38.     TapiOam: added result to OamJob.
    39.     TapiOam: removed the augments of OamProfile (which now is augmenting
    the generic Profile) to EventNotification and LogRecordBody.

Author: nigel-r-davis <ndavis@ciena.com>
Date:   Wed Jun 22 12:08:28 2022 +0100

    Various enhancements to the equipment model
    
    Correction to typos in various comments. Corrected comments in, or added
    comments to, classes, attributes and data types. (e.g., ActualEquipment,
    ActualHolder, ActualNonFieldReplaceableModule and
    CommonActualProperties).
    
    <<experimental>> stereotype removed from all entities.
    
    General improvements to diagram structure/layout.
    
    Corrections to CONDTIONAL_MANDATORY from MANDATORY along with addition
    of a condition for many attributes that are 0..x. Defaults added to many
    attributes to assist in construction of condition statements.
    
    Correction of wordings of CONDITIONAL_MANDATORY statements normalized to
    “Mandatory where…”.
    
    General correction from RW –-> R (e.g., equipmentNotExpected) and
    correction to many stereotypes to WRITE_NOT_ALLOWED (which was broadly
    inconsistent with Read Only statement).
    
    isExpectedActualMismatch clarified and made conditional on potential for
    expectation.
    
    _accessPort in PhysicalSpan from [2] to [1..*] to allow for multi-ended
    spans.
    
    _accessPort removed from PhysicalRoute and replaced with
    PhysicalRouteElement.
    
    Correction to splicedStrand (comment added)
    
    Changed comment in Physical Route to “The physical route of a connection
    is modeled as an ordered sequence of physical route element instances.
    The physical route is a description dedicated to the connection.”
    
    geographicalLocation is now 0..1 as many equipments are fixed by the
    containing equipment.
    
    Correction to the definition of equipment to allow expectation and/or
    actual statements (but not to represent non-field-replaceable hardware –
    the definition was originally derived from the core model and this used
    equipment for both roles).
    
    Updated pin and role.
    
    _physicalRoute in PhysicalRouteList is [*] (was [1..*] as a connection
    need not have a stated physical route and indeed in most cases does not
    have).
    
    Addition of StrandJoint to allow for expression of joint impairments and
    reflections via augmentation. FlowDirection has been enhancement from
    earlier discussions to allow for efficient expression of bidirectional
    impairments and bidirectional reflections to avoid having to restate
    values.
    
    localId added to physical route.
    
    Physical route made optional (as not all connections have physical
    route).
    
    connectorPinOrientation added to PinAndRole.
    
    Addition of equipmentNotExpected property in ExpectedEquipment to allow
    differentiation between the case of an explicit expectation of nothing
    present from no expectation.
    
    Change to multiplicity of commonEquipmentProperties in ExpectedEquipment
    to 0..1.
    
    PhyisicalRouteElementHasAccessPort association multiplicity corrected to
    0..1 at both ends to allow for case where the route is expressed via
    connector-pin alone.
    
    Comment on ConnectorPinOnEquipment end _equipment corrected to include
    both connector and pin.
    
    Comments removed from the diagram (the essence of each comment has been
    moved to the appropriate class).
    
    AbstractStrand in PhysicalSpan changed from [1..*] to [*] to allow for
    extremely lightweight model of the PhysicalSpan.
    
    AccessPort augmentation of SIP changed to be independent of equivalent
    for NEP as comments and labels were all for NEP and adjusting these
    proved challenging. Name changed/introduced AccessPortSupportingNep and
    AccessPortSupportingSip.
    
    ConnectorPinInOnEquipment… “InOn” typo corrected.

    Improvements to TAPI streaming
    Including:
    - A vast majority of fields are now CONDITIONAL_MANDATORY with clear
    conditions (some fields were inappropriately mandatory, some optional
    fields had no conditions stated)
    - New record types have been included to handle delta streaming more
    appropriately (CHANGE, UPDATE, CREATE) and to deal with records that are
    not simply related to change (INFORMATION)
    - New InformationRecordStrategy has been included to cover cases where
    PM data is to be sent (and associated enumerations for suppression etc.
    have been specified
    - The ConnectionProtocolDetails has been extended to include
    endcodingFormat (JSON, PROTOBUF, XML)
    - allowedConnectionProtocols has been formalized, from a dstring, to an
    extensible Enum (WEBSOCKETS, SSE, GNMI)
    - Figures have been improve in both structure and content
    - AnyClass usage has been clarified
    - ConditionDetectorType extended to include PM_THRESHOLD_DETECTOR to
    account for TapiFm enhancements

Author: amazzini <andrea.mazzini@nokia.com>
Date:   Sat Mar 26 01:14:14 2022 +0100

    Several Updates.
    
    - TapiTopology: added references from NEP to Profile.
    - TapiConnectivity: added references from CEP and CSEP to Profile.
    - TapiPhotonic: OtsiMcgCsepSpecAugmentsCsep replaces
    OtsiMcaCsepSpecAugmentsCsep.
    - TapiPhotonic: several experimental modifications for optical
    impairments.
    - TapiEquipment: PhysicalSpanIsSupportedByStrands from 1..* to 0..*.

    spectrumBandwidth property of OtsiFreqConfigPac. OtsiFreqConfigPac is
    renamed as OtsiConfig.
    - TapiPhotonic: removed the association OtsiSipHasPowerCapabilityPac,
    relying on CommonOrganizExplicit.
    - TapiOdu: Odu --> OtuFecPerformanceData, Odu --> OtnPmParameterName,
    Odu --> OtnMeasurementJob, preFecBer and postFecBer from integer to
    real.
    - TapiOam: ConnectivityOamJob augments CSEP (previously augmented CS)
    and OamJob refers to CSEP (previously to CS).
    - TapiPhotonic:
    OtsiCapabilityPac/supportableCentralFrequencySpectrumBand removed,
    replaced by CommonOrganizExplicit/min, max-central-frequency.
    - TapiPhotonic: OtsiCapabilityPac/supportedFecType removed, replaced by
    CommonExplicit/available-fec-type.
    - TapiPhotonic: OtsiCapabilityPac/supportableModulation removed,

    - TapiPhotonic: OtsiCapabilityPac/supportableApplicationIdentifier
    removed, replaced by the ItutStandardMode/applicationCode.
    - TapiOdu: OduOamMipServicePointHasOduMip can have 0..2 OduMips, not
    only 0..1 (codirectional becomes part of obj key), same for
    OduCtpCepHasOduMip but not OduMipSpecHasOduMip, because two Mip
    instances are expected.
    - TapiOdu: OduOamMepServicePoint and OduOamMipServicePoint may include
    the configuration of at most 1 MEP or MIP, because each
    (Connectivity)OamServicePoint may include the configuration of at most 1
    MEP or MIP.
    - TapiOam: OamProfile now augments generic Profile, is no longer
    composed by OamContext.
    - TapiOam: added ConnectivityOamService, which augments the CSEP and
    composes the ConnectivityOamServicePoints.
    - TapiOam: OamServicePoint and ConnectivityOamServicePoint have
    layerProtocolName and Qualifier, and AdminStatePac. Meg, Mep, Mip have
    layerProtocolName and Qualifier, and OperationalStatePac.
    - TapiOam: granularity period optional and isTransient in the PmData,
    added codirectional to PmData, removed layer name from OamService and
    Meg (name and qualif).
    - TapiOdu: deleted OtnMeasurementJob, timeOfTheDayAlignment moved to
    PmData.
    - TapiOdu: added numberOfOduC to OduTerminationAndClientAdaptationPac
    and deleted OduCnTtpPac.

    tcmLevel to OduTcmMep, OduTcmMip. Created OduTcmMegSpec, with tcmLevel
    attribute, augmenting Meg.
    - TapiConnectivity: added _serverConnection recursive reference to
    Connection.
    - TapiOdu: OduMepSpec, OduMipSpec --> OtnMepSpec, OtnMipSpec.
    - TapiPhotonic: SpectrumBand, upper/lower frequency now with type real.
    - TapiOam: ThresholdType, removed UPPER/LOWER_HIGH/LOW as they are
    boundaries for provisioning the values, i.e. capability.
    - TapiConnectivity: ServerConstraint --> LayerProtocolConstraint. ALL
    technology specific augments of CSEP are moved to the
    LayerProtocolConstraint, done for OTN. Added protocol name and qualifier
    to the LayerProtocolConstraint.
    - TapiOdu: OtuConnectivityServiceEndPointSpec now augments
    LayerProtocolConstraint. OduCnCsepTtpPac is no longer composed by
    OtuConnectivityServiceEndPointSpec, but directly augments
    LayerProtocolConstraint. Deleted OtuOtsiaCsepTtpPac.
    - TapiOdu: odu-delay-performance-data no longer augments oam-job, but
    CurrentData.
    - TapiOdu --> TapiDigitalOtn
    - TapiPhotonic: OtsiConfig centralFrequency now is a simple real/THz. No
    more info on grid/adjustments.

commit 55403693d8fc28caac24f0d290ef945fcfa9f76b
Author: amazzini <andrea.mazzini@nokia.com>
Date:   Thu Jan 6 19:00:11 2022 +0100

    Several modifications:
    
    1. TapiEquipment: added PhysicalRouteList (augmenting Connection),
    PhysicalRoute and ResiliencePhysicalRoute.
    
    2. TapiNotification: ObjectNotification class, delete the objectContent
    attribute, because 1) for bkw compatibility the 2.1.3 Notification model
    is still available in 2.3.x, 2) the content of the object is formally
    modeled by the augmentations of EventNotification and streaming
    LogRecordBody.
    
    3. TapiNotification: ObjectNotification class, change the type of
    changedAttributes attribute to simple string (for which the JSON-PATCH
    RFC6902 format is prescribed by the RIA 1.1).
    
    4. TapiNotification: Rename ObjectNotification class into
    AttributeValueChange class.
    
    5. TapiConnectivity: change ControlHasParameters association from
    ExtendedComposite to StrictComposite, similarly to the association
    between ConnectivityService and ResilienceConstraint.
    
    6. TapiFm: AlarmCategory enum, removed TCA entry as conceptually wrong.
    ITU-T X.733 Event type has different semantic: “the quality of service
    alarm type: An alarm of this type is principally associated with a
    degradation in the quality of a service.” Not really a TCA.
    
    7. TapiCommon: AlarmConditionName and PmParameterName, added NATIVE
    entry.
    
    8. TapiCommon: PmParameterValue is now composed by PmParameterValue,
    type Real (which allows either gauges or counters) and PmParameterUnit.
    
    9. TapiFm: AlarmInfo/nativeAlarmInfo from [0..1] to [1].
    
    10. TapiFm: TcaInfo, added nativeTcaInfo and tcaQualifier attributes.
    
    11. TapiFm: AlarmInfo/AlarmQualifier from name/value pairs to simple
    string. Similarly for TcaInfo/tcaQualifier,
    DetectedCondition/detectedConditionQualifier and
    detectedConditionNativeInfo.
    
    12. TapiFm: TcaInfo and PmMetricInfo, added granularityPeriod, optional.
    
    13. TapiFm: TcaInfo/oamJob from [1] to [0..1] for the cases the
    measurement job is not visible at the management interface.
    
    14. TapiFm: AlarmInfo, added nativeAlarmName, nativeAlarmInfo from [1]
    to [0..1]. TcaInfo, added nativeThresholdIndicatorName, nativeTcaInfo
    from [1] to [0..1].
    
    15. TapiOdu: OduPmParameterName, UAS_BID changed to UAS. The “NE/FE/BID”
    qualification is already present in OduErrorPerformanceData and is
    available in (notified/streamed)
    tcaQualifier/detectedConditionQualifier.
    
    16. TapiFm: TcaInfo, added tcaCategory.
    
    17. TapiTopology: added LocalClass to MultiplexingSequence.
    
    18. TapiCommon: introduced the Profile class, composed by TapiContext.
    
    19. TapiPhotonic: only UML, some experimental modifications for optical
    impairments.

commit 46bd9729a0a93c8c7b49577a3002b50b44d6e92a
Author: amazzini <andrea.mazzini@nokia.com>
Date:   Thu Nov 4 18:25:57 2021 +0100

    Several modifications:
    
    1. TapiNotification: ObjectNotification/objectNotificationType removed,
    added eventNotificationType to EventNotification with type
    NotificationType. NotificationType, removed DETECTED_CONDITION. The FM
    related augments (ALARM/TCA) are defined in TapiFm:FmNotificationType.
    
    2. TapiFm: DetectedCondition/DetectedConditionType removed, the
    information has been centralised in TapiNotification:EventNotification
    signal, through eventNotificationType attribute. AlarmNotificationType
    renamed as FmNotificationType and removed the Deprecated stereotype.
    
    3. Moved all augments from ObjectNotification to EventNotification.
    Added the "when 'derived-from-or-self" statement. Modules involved:
    Connectivity, Equipment, Notification, OAM, PathComp, Streaming,
    Topology, VirtualNtw.
    
    4. All modules moved to Yang 1.1.
    
    5. TapiConnectivity YANG: added “require-instance false” statement to
    grouping connection-ref.
    
    6. TapiPathComputation YANG: added “require-instance false” statement to
    grouping path-ref.
    
    7. TapiNotification: targetLocalObjectIdentifier from [1] to [0..1],
    targetObjectName from [1..*] to [0..*]
    
    8. TapiFm: Add to AlarmInfo, TcaInfo and DetectedCondition the augments
    to the Notification / EventNotification. Currently these structures are
    augmenting only the containers in the NotificationContext tree. In other
    words the YANG notifications shall be augmented besides the YANG
    groupings.
    
    9. TapiPathComputation: added PATH_OPTIMIZATION_CONSTRAINT and
    PATH_OBJECTIVE_FUNCTION to the PathComputationObjectType.
    
    10. Corrected all identities not following underscore convention.
    Modules involved: Connectivity, PhotonicMedia, Odu, Eth.
