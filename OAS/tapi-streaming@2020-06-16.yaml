        \ functionality in the FC (Connection). \r\n            If an FC exposes protection\
        \ (having two or more FcPorts that provide alternative identical inputs/outputs),\
        \ the FC will have one or more associated FcSwitch objects to represent the\
        \ alternative flow choices visible at the edge of the FC.\r\n            The\
        \ FC switch represents and defines a protection switch structure encapsulated\
        \ in the FC. \r\n            Essentially performs one of the functions of\
        \ the Protection Group in a traditional model. It associates to 2 or more\
        \ FcPorts each playing the role of a Protection Unit. \r\n            One\
        \ or more protection, i.e. standby/backup, FcPorts provide protection for\
        \ one or more working (i.e. regular/main/preferred) FcPorts where either protection\
        \ or working can feed one or more protected FcPort.\r\n            The switch\
        \ may be used in revertive or non-revertive (symmetric) mode. When in revertive\
        \ mode it may define a waitToRestore time.\r\n            It may be used in\
        \ one of several modes including source switch, destination switched, source\
        \ and destination switched etc (covering cases such as 1+1 and 1:1).\r\n \
        \           It may be locked out (prevented from switching), force switched\
        \ or manual switched.\r\n            It will indicate switch state and change\
        \ of state.\r\n            The switch can be switched away from all sources\
        \ such that it becomes open and hence two coordinated switches can both feed\
        \ the same LTP so long as at least one of the two is switched away from all\
        \ sources (is 'open').\r\n            The ability for a Switch to be 'high\
        \ impedance' allows bidirectional ForwardingConstructs to be overlaid on the\
        \ same bidirectional LTP where the appropriate control is enabled to prevent\
        \ signal conflict.\r\n            This ability allows multiple alternate routes\
        \ to be present that otherwise would be in conflict."
