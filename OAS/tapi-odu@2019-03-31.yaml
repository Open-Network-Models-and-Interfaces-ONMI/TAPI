        \ represent the alternative flow choices visible at the edge of the forwarding\
        \ entity.\r\n            The Switch instance represents and defines a protection\

        \            The Switch instance essentially performs one of the functions\
        \ of the Protection Group in a traditional model. It associates to 2 or more\
        \ (conceptual) ports each playing the role of a Protection Unit. \r\n    \

        \ such as 1+1 and 1:1).\r\n            It may be locked out (prevented from\
        \ switching), force switched or manual switched.\r\n            It will indicate\

        \ switches can both feed the same (conceptual) port or CEP so long as at least\
        \ one of the two is switched away from all sources (is 'open').\r\n      \
        \      The ability for a Switch to be 'high impedance' allows bidirectional\
        \ forwarding entities to be overlaid on the same bidirectional CEP where the\
        \ appropriate control is enabled to prevent signal conflict.\r\n         \
