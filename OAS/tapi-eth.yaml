        \ ConnectionEndPoint (CEP) instances. \r\n            A resilient forwarding\
        \ entity may have two or more (conceptual) ports that provide alternative\
        \ identical inputs/outputs, and one or more associated Switch instances to\
        \ represent the alternative flow choices visible at the edge of the forwarding\
        \ entity.\r\n            The Switch instance represents and defines a protection\
        \ switch structure conceptually encapsulated in the forwarding entity. \r\n\
        \            The Switch instance essentially performs one of the functions\
        \ of the Protection Group in a traditional model. It associates to 2 or more\
        \ (conceptual) ports each playing the role of a Protection Unit. \r\n    \
        \        One or more protection, i.e. standby/backup, conceptual ports provide\
        \ protection for one or more working (i.e. regular/main/preferred) ports where\
        \ either protection or working can feed one or more protected port.\r\n  \
        \          The switch may be used in revertive or non-revertive (symmetric)\
        \ mode. When in revertive mode it may define a waitToRestore time.\r\n   \
        \         It may be used in one of several modes including source switch,\
        \ destination switched, source and destination switched, etc. (covering cases\
        \ such as 1+1 and 1:1).\r\n            It may be locked out (prevented from\
        \ switching), force switched or manual switched.\r\n            It will indicate\
        \ switch state and change of state.\r\n            The Switch can be switched\
        \ away from all sources such that it becomes open and hence two coordinated\
        \ switches can both feed the same (conceptual) port or CEP so long as at least\
        \ one of the two is switched away from all sources (is 'open').\r\n      \
        \      The ability for a Switch to be 'high impedance' allows bidirectional\
        \ forwarding entities to be overlaid on the same bidirectional CEP where the\
        \ appropriate control is enabled to prevent signal conflict.\r\n         \
        \   This ability allows multiple alternate routes to be present that otherwise\
        \ would be in conflict."
