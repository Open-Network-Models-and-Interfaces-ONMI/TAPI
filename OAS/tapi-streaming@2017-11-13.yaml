        \ may be used in revertive or non-revertive (symmetric) mode. When in revertive\
        \ mode it may define a waitToRestore time.\r\n            It may be used in\
        \ one of several modes including source switch, destination switched, source\
        \ and destination switched etc (covering cases such as 1+1 and 1:1).\r\n \
        \           It may be locked out (prevented from switching), force switched\
        \ or manual switched.\r\n            It will indicate switch state and change\
        \ of state.\r\n            The switch can be switched away from all sources\
        \ such that it becomes open and hence two coordinated switches can both feed\
        \ the same LTP so long as at least one of the two is switched away from all\
        \ sources (is 'open').\r\n            The ability for a Switch to be 'high\
        \ impedance' allows bidirectional ForwardingConstructs to be overlaid on the\
        \ same bidirectional LTP where the appropriate control is enabled to prevent\
        \ signal conflict.\r\n            This ability allows multiple alternate routes\
        \ to be present that otherwise would be in conflict."
