Discussion item 1
General update
40 mins

1) Move to LF
   + LF has confirmed that they will provide, without costs
     - Conference call platform and Github repository
   + No updates regarding the TR-547/8 copyright
     - No indication if the name will remain TR or something different
   + Nigel and Lyndon have provided the MoU draft to TIP for review
     - to formalize the TIP strong influence on TAPI TRs
     - defending and protecting from the overly liberal environment of LF
   + Andrea will contact Kam to start planning the publication of TAPI at ITU-T
     - Explore a possible MoU also with ITU-T

2) 2.5.0 Review: plan for corrections and enhancements
   + Andrea shows the new repository for the 2.5.0 patches:
     https://github.com/OpenNetworkingFoundation/TAPI/tree/tapi-2_5_0-fixes/TAPI-FIXES
   + So far defined two patches, regarding Photonic Media and Notification modules
   + The patches are defined in separate Yang modules, as augments of 2.5.0 constructs
     - this allows to maintain unaltered the original 2.5.0 Yang modules
   + Esther comments that OpenConfig delivers a new version when corrections are necessary
     - Nigel answers that each vendor already has a framework for proprietary augments
       + the standard patches can follow same pattern
   + Nigel (and Andrea) are available to present the TAPI patch mechanism to TIP

Discussion item 2
Photonic Model: fix/update of the transceiver provisioning model
50 mins

Andrea shows the updated UML diagrams
- Esther clarifies that the transceiver profile models both capabilities and configuration
  + no need of further tuning at configuration time, the selected profile instance tells it all
  + in other words, the profile instance constrains the provisioning
- Nigel suggests that a more generic model should be the target, where each parameter can be expressed for 
  + capability, intent/setting, state/threshold
- Esther clarifies that minOsnrMargin and totalChannelOutputPower are PM metrics
  + hence shall be removed from the Explicit Profile
  + Also _powerManagementConfigPac to be removed

- Esther provides the list of OpenConfig PM metrics:
  https://github.com/OpenNetworkingFoundation/TAPI/tree/tapi-team-activities/TAPI-TEAM-ACTIVITIES/Contributions/openconfig-pms.txt
  + Andrea will review and map/add to TAPI
    - Purpose is the correct mapping of PM metrics detected on OpenConfig side and then passed to TAPI i/f
