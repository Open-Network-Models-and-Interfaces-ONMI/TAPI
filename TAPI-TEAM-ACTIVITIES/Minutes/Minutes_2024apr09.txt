Discussion item 1
General update
30 mins

1) Move to LF
   + No updates regarding the TR-547/8 copyright
     - No indication if the name will remain TR or something different
   + Andrea will contact Kam to start planning the publication of TAPI at ITU-T
     - Explore a possible MoU also with ITU-T and MEF
   + TIP - LF MoU
     - Nigel, we need to clarify with Scott Nicholas that we are not overcommitting with TIP, rather maintaining the previous level of commitment.
   + ONMI TST
     - agreed to contact some
	   + current members to check if they are still interested and willing to contribute
	   + candidate new members (e.g. Esther and Jonathan)
	     - major role being the TAPI release approval


2) 2.5.1 Review and final approval
   + Andrea shows the draft 2.5.1 release based on
	 - https://github.com/OpenNetworkingFoundation/TAPI/tree/tapi-2_5_0-fixes
   + Proposal is agreed with some amendments in the text - Andrea delivers https://github.com/OpenNetworkingFoundation/TAPI/releases/tag/2.5.1
 
 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Discussion item 2
- UC 11a: “Modification of service path” and UML/YANG comments
  + Clarification of connection inclusion/exclusion constraints
20 mins

Andrea briefly shows the text of UC11a, proposing to add "connection inclusion/exclusion" to the UC
- to drive the rerouting of an existing Connectivity Service

In addition, the current comments in the UML/YANG could be extended, to allow both the:
- inclusion/exclusion of orphan Connections (Connections without intent/CS), and
- inclusion/exclusion of server layer Connections for routing constraints
  + both at creation time and update time

Discussion to be continued.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Discussion item 3
- UC 11b: “Modification of service nominal route to secondary (protection) route for maintenance operations”
  + Unidirectional switching of bidirectional service/connection
10 mins

Andrea briefly shows some slides regarding the possible deprecation of "CSEPHasForwardingPeerCSEP" relationship between CSEPs
- because replaced by A/Z tagging

Discussion to be continued.
