Discussion item 1
General update
50 mins

1) Move to LF
     - OTCC/OIMT TST still evaluating ownerships and other relevant aspects of the new affiliation.
     - LF representative has distributed this draft charter of ONMI project:
       https:/docs.google.com/document/d/1Ubea6hh6riJ-ym7B1dKuI54HlHtuKED35-i7gt3JB5o/
     - Arturo, as TIP Technical Program Manager, is exploring the chance for a landing of TAPI in TIP.
       + TIP MUST is the project mostly interested in the survivability of TAPI.
     - Noted that there is no opportunity for liaison to/from LF.

2) Nigel clarifies that Core IM work has been officially stopped in ONF, hence further developments are possible only at ITU-T.

3) Next week Jonathan will present the path computation use cases.

4) Next week Andrea will send the invitation considering the possible discontinue of ONF meeting room.

Discussion item 2
Path computation: Path as routing constraint
70 mins

Andrea shows the Photonic Model diagrams regarding the provisioning of the Connectivity Service,
  with the purpose to identify the more appropriate places where to add CCAMP optical path constraints.

- Nigel: in TAPI, the Path is intended as a set of links composing a possible route in the network,
         considering the topological reachability, while the computation of the route of the
         Connectivity Service implies the service feasibility considering all the technology specific constraints,
         hence driving and leveraging all the info available at server controller.

- Esther essentially confirms that CCAMP Path computation is more similar to TAPI Connectivity Service computation,
  with the difference that the CCAMP Path is not necessarily deployed in the network, but can be used for network planning use cases.

- Andrea: we need to develop use cases to progress the TAPI Path Computation - considering CCAMP approach.

- Andrea shows that the 2.5.0 photonic model is using the transceiver profile for both
  + specification of transceiver capabilities / features
  + provisioning of transceiver (at connectivity service provisioning time)
  Agreed that this is not correct, hence Andrea will amend the model to decouple profiles and provisioning management.

- This and some other found issues seem requiring a short term delivery of a 2.5.1 version.
