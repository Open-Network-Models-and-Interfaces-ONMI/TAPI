Discussion item 1
General update
20 mins

1) Delivery of corrected OAS modules
     - The amended OAS modules are available here:
       https://github.com/OpenNetworkingFoundation/TAPI/tree/tapi-team-activities/TAPI-TEAM-ACTIVITIES/RIA/Ancillary/OAS_250_Corrected
     - A warning has been added to the v2.5.0 release page:
       https://github.com/OpenNetworkingFoundation/TAPI/releases/tag/v2.5.0
     - Andrea is testing an amended version of the yang2oas tool, recently provided by Bartosz

2) Move to LF
     - Nigel provides an update
       + The next hour the ONF leadership will present the transition to LF
         (Post meeting note: no relevant news for OIMT/OTCC --> ONMI)
       + LF representative has scheduled another call next week (Thu 18 - "Launching ONMI @ LF")
       + LF seems an unstructured container for around 1000 projects.
         - Apparently some projects are federating "bottom-up", of our interest could be the LF Networking group
           https://lfnetworking.org/
     - Esther asks whether TIP MUST is aware of ONF disbanding
       + Nigel has contacted Arturo before the holidays, will check
     - Andrea is contacting Nokia colleagues already active in LF Networking

3) Decision regarding blog publishing / testimonials availability
     - Nigel will contact Arturo for the possible publication of TAPI 2.5.0 blog in TIP MUST pages.

Discussion item 2
Path computation: Path as routing constraint, reference OIF 2023.436
40 mins

Jonathan presents a slideset
  - highlighted the difference between link and path constraints
    + Path constraints apply to the end to end path
  - Nigel considers "post analysis" scenario:
    + Firstly the paths are calculated based on e.g. some shortest path criteria
    + Secondly the calculated paths are validated against the (optical) constraints
    + Agreed that the "on the fly" path computation could be very complex, although desirable.
  - Nigel asks about the semantic of optical constraints
    + Esther replies that IETF is well advanced on the topic.
    + Post meeting note:
      Andrea asked Sergio - below listed the most relevant references:
      https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-teas-yang-path-computation/
