Disclaimer:
ONF is disbanding and merging into Linux Foundation.
Until is not fully clarified and agreed under which entity this project will land,
no final decisions will be taken by the TAPI team for the TAPI next versions.
TAPI team will at most agree recommendations, with final agreement postponed.

Attendees
- Andrea Mazzini
- Jonathan Sadler
- Esther Le Rouzic (TIP OOPT/MUST)
- Nigel Davis
- Dominique Verchere
- Brian Johnson
- Qilei Wang


Tentative agenda:

- General update
  + Update on Linux Foundation
  + 2.5.0 Review: approve draft patches
  + Proposal to close all issues older than 2023
    - Agree the text for the issues closed due to age
- Photonic Model: continue the fix/update of the transceiver provisioning model
  + check transceiver profile and transceiver parameters
- Continue the discussion on digital payload of photonic media
- Model for Multi-technology Network Interface


Next Call, March 26

- Update on Linux Foundation
- 2.5.0 Review: final approval of draft patches
- Decision regarding 2.5.0 with separate patches or 2.5.1 including patches
- Photonic Model: continue the fix/update of the transceiver provisioning model
  + check transceiver profile parameters
- Continue the discussion on digital payload of photonic media
- Model for Multi-technology Network Interface
- Review 2.6.0 plan, agree priorities, assign owners

Discussion item 1
General update
60 mins

1) Move to LF
   + No updates regarding the TR-547/8 copyright
     - No indication if the name will remain TR or something different
   + Nigel and Lyndon have provided the MoU draft to TIP for review
     - Lyndon has forwarded the copy reviewed by TIP to Scott Nicholas at Linux Foundation for final review and approval 
   + Andrea will contact Kam to start planning the publication of TAPI at ITU-T
     - Explore a possible MoU also with ITU-T and MEF
   + Identified three top priority items regarding the migration:
     1) ONMI project landing page at LF website
	 2) Github reorganization
	 3) Mailing lists reorganization
	 
   + Regarding mailing lists, a possible way forward is to:
    1) Close the Transport API (https://groups.google.com/a/opennetworking.org/g/transport-api)
       Informing the current members if they are interested in the affiliation to "omni-tapi"
    2) Close the Open Transport Configuration & Control (https://groups.google.com/a/opennetworking.org/g/opentransport)
       Informing the current members if they are interested in the affiliation to "omni-project" (new)
    3) Close the Wireless Transport (https://groups.google.com/a/opennetworking.org/g/wireless-transport)
	   Informing the current members if they are interested in the affiliation to "omni-t-wireless" (new)
    4) Close the IISOMI (Informal Inter-SDO Open Model Initiative) (https://groups.google.com/a/opennetworking.org/g/iisomi)
       Informing the current members if they are interested in the affiliation to "omni-iisomi" (new)
    5) Close the Open Information Model & Tooling (https://groups.google.com/a/opennetworking.org/g/information-modeling)
       Informing the current members if they are interested in the affiliation to "omni-iisomi" (new),
       and that the Core IM project is now moved at ITU-T
    6) Regarding onmi-tst, a decision shall be taken regarding keeping the TST or just agree project moderators.

2) 2.5.0 Review: plan for corrections and enhancements
   + Esther reports the perplexities regarding the currently proposed management of patches for TAPI version 2.5.0
     - Why these two branches have been defined?
       + https://github.com/OpenNetworkingFoundation/TAPI/tree/tapi-team-activities and
	   + https://github.com/OpenNetworkingFoundation/TAPI/tree/tapi-2_5_0-fixes
	   Normally it is delivered a new version including the corrections, no need of additional branches.
	 - Nigel explains that we need to keep separate threads from main "https://github.com/OpenNetworkingFoundation/TAPI" for
	   + activities related to TAPI 2.5.0 (patches), i.e. that will never be part of any release different from TAPI 2.5.0
	   + activities independent to releases (contributions, meeting minutes, etc.), i.e. that will never be part of any TAPI release
	 - A possible compromise would be to create a TAPI 2.5.1 delivery composed by:
	   + TAPI 2.5.0 contents, and
	   + TAPI 2.5.0 patches
	 - Agreed that there are pros and cons:
       + clearer identification of a TAPI package
       + proliferation of deliveries with very similar content	   
	 - For further discussion - also necessary the opinion of TIP

  3) Proposal to close all issues older than 2023
    - agreed, but for the issues opened by Service Providers - for further review
	- the other issues will be closed adding this comment:
	  + "This issue has been closed due to the lack of activity for more than one year.
	    Please reopen it if follow up is necessary."

Discussion item 2
Photonic Model: fix/update of the transceiver provisioning model
30 mins

Andrea is editing a document including the OpenConfig and CCAMP PM metrics
  - References are
    + https://github.com/openconfig/public/blob/master/release/models/optical-transport/openconfig-terminal-device.yang
	+ https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-ccamp-dwdm-if-param-yang/10/
  - Regarding Transceiver Modes, it seems confirmed that G.698.2 left a degree of freedom regarding line-coding-bitrate
    + For the following parameters it seems that they could be needed for both profile/template and transceiver instance:
	
	 +--ro min-central-frequency?
 	 |       frequency-thz
 	 +--ro max-central-frequency?
 	 |       frequency-thz
 	 +--ro transceiver-tunability?
 	 |       frequency-ghz
 	 +--ro tx-channel-power-min?     power-dbm
 	 +--ro tx-channel-power-max?     power-dbm
 	 +--ro rx-channel-power-min?     power-dbm
 	 +--ro rx-channel-power-max?     power-dbm
 	 +--ro rx-total-power-max?       power-dbm

  - Instead to add further parameters to the standard profile, maybe define a new, fourth one like "standard delta".
