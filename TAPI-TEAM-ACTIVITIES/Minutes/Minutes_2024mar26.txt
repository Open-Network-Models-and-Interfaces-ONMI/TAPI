Disclaimer:
ONF is disbanding and merging into Linux Foundation.
Until is not fully clarified and agreed under which entity this project will land,
no final decisions will be taken by the TAPI team for the TAPI next versions.
TAPI team will at most agree recommendations, with final agreement postponed.

Discussion item 1
General update
60 mins

1) Move to LF
   + No updates regarding the TR-547/8 copyright
     - No indication if the name will remain TR or something different
   + Nigel and Lyndon have provided the MoU draft to TIP for review
     - Lyndon has forwarded the copy reviewed by TIP to Scott Nicholas at Linux Foundation for final review and approval 
   + Andrea will contact Kam to start planning the publication of TAPI at ITU-T
     - Explore a possible MoU also with ITU-T and MEF
   + Last Wednesday Lyndon and myself had a call with LF assistant for some practical items (ONMI Github, mailing lists, etc.)
   + Tomorrow is scheduled another call, including more LF representatives   

2) New https://github.com/orgs/Open-Network-Models-and-Interfaces-ONMI/repositories
   + Andrea shows the initial editing of new ONMI Github repository
   + Esther: better to store the meeting minutes in a repository rather than in the wiki
     This allows control on possible modifications
   + Esther, is there any LF recommendation / best practice?
     - Nigel, more likely to find recommendations in some specific project

3) 2.5.0 Review: plan for corrections and enhancements
   + Esther confirms the perplexities regarding the currently proposed management of patches for TAPI version 2.5.0
   + Anders indicates that also Telia is preferring a 2.5.1 version
   + Arturo thinks it is more clear a 2.5.1 version
     - Andrea will create the new delivery, based on
	   + https://github.com/OpenNetworkingFoundation/TAPI/tree/tapi-2_5_0-fixes
	   + where the defined patches are considered as agreed
   + Nigel, TIP then shall refer to "latest 2.5.x version", rather than to 2.5.0

4) Brief review of open/closed issues
   + Andrea shows the few remaining open issues
     https://github.com/OpenNetworkingFoundation/TAPI/issues
   + All the other issues have been closed, as agreed last week
	 - Note that the closed issues are still available

5) IETF 119 (https://www.ietf.org/how/meetings/119/)
   + Nigel provides a summary of the discussions which may concern TAPI
     - Pluggable Use Cases under development, see:
       + https://github.com/oscargdd/draft-poidt-ccamp-actn-poi-pluggable-usecases-gaps/pull/6#pullrequestreview-1915210804
       + https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-poidt-ccamp-actn-poi-pluggable-usecases-gaps/
       + Discussion on the photonic parameters of the pluggable, trying to rationalize the definitions coming from different sources
       + Still to be explored the electrical parameters of the pluggable
	   + Each parameter shall be considered in terms of
	     1) capability,
	     2) configurable property,
	     3) state,
	     all crossed with lifecycle.
	   + Notable use case foresees the installation of a pluggable as a result of network planning
	     - Pluggable are expensive and their installation needs careful evaluation
	     - The equipment shows the capability to install a transceiver - this capability being a potential end point of a service
	 - Digital Map, see:
	   + https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-havel-nmop-digital-map/
	   + Model for the evaluation of traffic patterns and failure consequences
	   + An opportunity for the alignment of TAPI and RFC 8345 topology models
	 - Nigels also underlines that in IETF seems missing the representation of the TAPI Connection End Point (CEP)
	   + for further evaluation
	 - Inventory (https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/ivy/about/)
	   + Agreed the following distinct areas:
	     - Functional (not in the IVY scope)
		 - Physical, i.e. that can be measured by a ruler
		 - Info, e.g. PM data, Sw (the code)
		 - Motivational, e.g. the power supply (not in the IVY scope)
	 - Incident / Problem analysis, see:
	   + https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-feng-nmop-network-incident-yang/
	   + Development of concepts that can be brought in TAPI

Discussion item 2
Photonic Model: fix/update of the transceiver provisioning model
10 mins

Andrea asks if there are news/progresses in https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-ccamp-optical-impairment-topology-yang/
  - No news, hence agreed that Andrea will adapt TAPI transceiver model according to currently available definitions


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Discussion item 3
Continue the discussion on digital payload of photonic media
40 mins

Andrea shows some new figures regarding the transponder to transponder connectivity
  - General agreement on the approach
  - The management of inverse multiplexing can be attached to the
    + OTU/ODU or OTSiMCA CEP instance, unique client of the NEP which represents the digital payload supported by one or more optical carriers
  - Use dash-dot line for alternative choices in the functional stack
  - Agreed that descriptions - of even multiple cases - anyway reduce the variety of implementations
