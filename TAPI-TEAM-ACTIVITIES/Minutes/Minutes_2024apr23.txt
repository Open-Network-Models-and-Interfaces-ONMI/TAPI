Disclaimer:
ONF is disbanding and merging into Linux Foundation.
Until is not fully clarified and agreed under which entity this project will land,
no final decisions will be taken by the TAPI team for the TAPI next versions.
TAPI team will at most agree recommendations, with final agreement postponed.

Discussion item 1
General update
30 mins

1) Move to LF
   + No updates regarding the TR-547/8 copyright
     - No indication if the name will remain TR or something different
   + Andrea will contact Kam to start planning the publication of TAPI at ITU-T
     - Explore a possible MoU also with ITU-T and MEF
	 - Still to understand if a liaison with ITU-T would be possible, as LF seems not supporting a centralized liaison management
   + TIP - LF MoU
     - Nigel, we still need to clarify with Scott Nicholas that we are not overcommitting with TIP, rather maintaining the previous level of commitment.
	   + We need Arturo to continue the discussion
   + Nigel: Git update
     - Nigel has admin rights over ONF git repository
	   + Will plan to coordinate migration, including Italo and Andrea
   + Nigel: Specifications in two places
     - Bernd Zeuner pointed out that the https://github.com/Open-Network-Models-and-Interfaces-ONMI/onf-specifications
	   + has old published versions of the documents, and
       + these documents are also available in other git repositories. Hence a concern over duplication and confusion.
       + Agreed that this is a historic repository of documents generated whilst the work was in ONF
       + Agreed to properly restructure the repository
   + ONMI TST
     - agreed to contact some
	   + current members to check if they are still interested and willing to contribute
	   + candidate new members (e.g. Esther and Jonathan)
	     - major role being the TAPI release approval

	 
2) Use Cases separately defined by Operators
   + Nigel: we need to find a way to keep consistent naming of
     - UC part of TR-547
	 - UC not (yet?) part of TR-547
   + Anders: Telia is updating their specification according to TR-547 3.1

Discussion item 2
- UC 11a: “Modification of service path” and UML/YANG comments
  + Clarification of connection inclusion/exclusion constraints
40 mins

Andrea briefly shows the text of UC11a, proposing to add "connection inclusion/exclusion" to the UC
- to drive the rerouting of an existing Connectivity Service

In addition, the current comments in the UML/YANG could be extended, to allow both the:
- inclusion/exclusion of server layer Connections for routing constraints
  + both at creation time and update time
- inclusion/exclusion of orphan Connections at the same layer
  + only at creation time

Server layer Connection:
- agreed that only suitable connections can be used for inclusion constraint
  + feasible means ready for usage by client layer, e.g. terminated connection which provides the client link
  + not feasible means more corner cases where e.g. termination and adaptation is not yet available, single cross connection, etc.
- exclusion constraint can consider a wider set of Connection types
  
Same layer orphan Connection:
- it should be possible to reconcile an existing Connection to a creating Connectivity Service
  + to enable further editing through TAPI i/f
- if the existing Connection does not span the entire intended route of the creating Connectivity Service
  + then we may end up with a further partitioning level
  + Discussion to be continued
