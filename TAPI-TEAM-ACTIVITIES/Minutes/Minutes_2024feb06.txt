Disclaimer:
ONF is disbanding and merging into Linux Foundation
Until is not fully clarified and agreed under which entity this project will land,
no final decisions will be taken by the TAPI team for the TAPI next versions.
TAPI team will at most agree recommendations, with final agreement postponed.

Discussion item 1
General update
20 mins

1) Move to LF - this is the first call after ONF merging with LF, see disclaimer above.
   - OTCC/OIMT TST still evaluating ownerships and other relevant aspects of the new affiliation.
   - LF representative has distributed this draft charter of ONMI project:
     https:/docs.google.com/document/d/1Ubea6hh6riJ-ym7B1dKuI54HlHtuKED35-i7gt3JB5o/
   - Arturo, as TIP Technical Program Manager, is exploring the chance for a landing of TAPI in TIP.
     + TIP MUST is the project mostly interested in the survivability of TAPI.
   - Noted that there is no opportunity for liaison to/from LF.

2) Kam and Nigel inform that Core IM has been published at ONF website.
   + Agreed to do the same with TAPI 2.5.0 and the RIAs 3.1

3) Next week Andrea is not available, agreed to cancel the call.

Discussion item 2
Path computation: Path as routing constraint
40 mins

Jonathan presents a slide set for the Optical Path Computation and Restoration.
- Since 2003 OIF is interested in network control.
- What is new? The dynamic optical path connection, where optical is analogue technology.
  + Very high rates, no multiplexing, increasingly complex modulation.
- The concept of aggregation (rather than sum) of the optical impairments along the route.
- Listed the candidate metrics of optical impairments.
  + Esther: same approach as GNPy.
- Discussion on photonic ENNI, agreed that multi-operator is difficult to implement, reluctance of publishing internals.
  + For now let's focus on optical path computation within a single domain,
    then will evaluate if the info necessary for multi-domain computation can be published keeping sensitive info hidden.
- Andrea asks Jonathan whether pre-computation of paths has been considered.
  + Jonathan, no because the approach does not scale.
  + Hence the computation & realization is "on the fly", Jonathan has seen restorations concluded in less than one second.

Discussion item 3
Photonic Model: fix the transceiver provisioning model
30 mins

Andrea shows the related UML diagrams of version 2.5.0
- After some discussion, it was agreed that:
  + The purpose of the transceiver profile (aka template or spec) is to provide the library of capabilities.
    - Hence the proper SIP/NEP shall include a list of one or more supported profiles,
      representing the supported transceiver modes.
    - This capability information is normally available at server controller.
  + The transceiver profile is read-only.
  + The main use case of the transceiver provisioning is by specifying
    - the central frequency and other info which are orthogonal to the transceiver mode,
    - the reference to the chosen profile instance (transceiver mode).
  + To be further explored the explicit provisioning of some "capability" parameters
    - with or without specifying a profile.
    - Arturo confirms that some legacy transceivers required some parameters "on the fly".

- Esther indicates that TAPI needs an alignment to the more recent versions of OpenConfig and IETF specifications.
  + IETF: https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-ccamp-optical-impairment-topology-yang/14/

- Esther also clarifies that the transceiver standard profile needs also the line-coding-rate parameter to be fully defined.
  + ITU-T it was decided to not include this parameter to improve flexibility.

Discussion item 4
Continue the discussion on digital payload of photonic media
30 mins

Andrea indicates that so far the TAPI RIA has foreseen transponder to transponder connectivities in strict conformance to G.709 OTN payload.
- This could be a limitation, given the variety of existing solutions, e.g.
  + OTN but not G.709
  + Non OTN

- Andrea shows some figures with a different organization of NEP/CEP stack:
  1) Introducing a new OTSiMCA CEP.
  2) Either encapsulate the OTU parameters in the ODU CEP (given the fixed 1:1 relationship), or keep the OTU CEP separated.

- Preliminary agreed that the OTSiMCA could or could not be terminated on the regenerators.
  + In case it is terminated, then the OTSiMCA Connectivity Service will list - in case of regens - more OTSiMCA Top Connections.
    - Hence no end to end Top connection for the OTSiMCA Connectivity Service.
  + In case it is not terminated (the regens manage the pass-through) then the OTSiMCA Connectivity Service will have only one e2e Top Connection.

- To be explored whether the new OTSiMCA CS model will be added to or will replace the current one.
