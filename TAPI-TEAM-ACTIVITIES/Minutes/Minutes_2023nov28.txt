General update
20 mins

1) 2.5.0 OAS issues

Discussion item 2
Progress on digital payload of photonic media
60 mins

Andrea shows the slides 141 - 160 of the otcc2022.AM.001_TAPI_RIASlides.pptx, available in the contributions
  (https://github.com/OpenNetworkingFoundation/TAPI/tree/tapi-team-activities/TAPI-TEAM-ACTIVITIES/Contributions)
- Nigel recalls that a generalization of the transponder to transponder connectivity was asked by Ramon a while ago
- So far the transponder to transponder connectivity design is centered on supporting digital OTN payload
  + ODUk or ODUCn Connectivity Service, which provisioning params include all photonic provisioning (transceiver mode, central freq. etc.)
- Discussed to which degree the transponder to transponder connectivity shall include digital payolad details
- Preliminary agreed that the model shall be designed to encompass more flavours / scenarios
