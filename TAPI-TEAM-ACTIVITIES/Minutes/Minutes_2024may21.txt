Disclaimer:
ONF is disbanding and merging into Linux Foundation.
Until is not fully clarified and agreed under which entity this project will land,
no final decisions will be taken by the TAPI team for the TAPI next versions.
TAPI team will at most agree recommendations, with final agreement postponed.

Discussion item 1
General update
20 mins

1) New TAPI wiki pages
  + Andrea shows the
    - TAPI wiki (https://github.com/Open-Network-Models-and-Interfaces-ONMI/TAPI/wiki), which now includes the links to all TAPI meeting minutes
    - TAPI discussions (https://github.com/Open-Network-Models-and-Interfaces-ONMI/TAPI/discussions)
	  where the contents discussed in the TAPI calls are extracted and collected together
	- No objections registered
	
2) Move to LF
   + LF - TIP MoU
     - Nigel and Andrea will synchronize to get endorsements by SPs
	 - Jonathan agreed regarding a statement of TAPI usage by OIF interops


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Discussion item 2
- Node - Device linkage
10 mins

Nigel presents a slide with the detailed proposal regarding the simplification of the relationship between Node and Device
  - A new reference by name will be added from Node to Device, many to many.
  - Proposal is agreed
  

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Discussion item 3
- Definition of patterns for a description of model navigation
  - functional to consistency and compliance tests
20 mins

Nigel presents some slides with examples of server and lower connection relationships
1) Connectivity Service "outer" navigation, with a proposal for navigation steps
   - Purpose is the automation of these navigation steps, to validate the correctness of data structure
2) Connectivity Service "inner" navigation, with a proposal for navigation steps
   - where more complex navigation paths can be defined
- In general, there is a requirement to define loops which can automatically validate most part of TAPI data structures.

- Andrea shows slide 142, 156, 157, 158 of onmi2024.AM.002_TAPI_RIASlides20052024.pptx
  (https://github.com/Open-Network-Models-and-Interfaces-ONMI/TAPI/blob/tapi-team-activities/TAPI-TEAM-ACTIVITIES/Contributions/onmi2024.AM.002_TAPI_RIASlides20052024.pptx)
  + It is proposed a pattern to allow a clean split between L1 and L0 diagrams, to avoid duplication of management items along the slideset.
  + The approach is preliminary agreed.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Discussion item 4
- UC 11a: “Modification of service path” and UML/YANG comments
  + Clarification of connection inclusion/exclusion constraints
30 mins

Andrea shows some slides updated according to last week discussions (onmi2024.AM.002_TAPI_RIASlides20052024.pptx, slides 445 .. 461)
- Agreed to add "fixed" boolean attribute to Connection object (similarly to TMF-MTNM)
- Agreed the proposed text
- Andrea will accordingly updated the UML comments and the RIA UC.
