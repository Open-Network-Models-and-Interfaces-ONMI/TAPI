Disclaimer:
ONF is disbanding and merging into Linux Foundation.
Until is not fully clarified and agreed under which entity this project will land,
no final decisions will be taken by the TAPI team for the TAPI next versions.
TAPI team will at most agree recommendations, with final agreement postponed.

Attendees
- Andrea Mazzini
- Nigel Davis
- Qilei Wang
- Kam Lam
- Brian Johnson
- Gabriele Galimberti
- Roshan Joyce


Tentative agenda:

- General update
  + Update on Linux Foundation
  + Brief review of open/closed issues
- Spotlight/snapshot stream to "get current data" e.g. on periodical time on selected monitors
- Navigation IETF <--> TAPI
- UC 11a: “Modification of service path” and UML/YANG comments
  + Clarification of connection inclusion/exclusion constraints
- UC 11b: “Modification of service nominal route to secondary (protection) route for maintenance operations”
  + Unidirectional switching of bidirectional service/connection
- Photonic Model: continue the fix/update of the transceiver provisioning model
  + check transceiver profile and transceiver parameters
  + GOSNR (Generalized OSNR) approach and possible enhancements to the explicit profile
- Continue the discussion on digital payload of photonic media
- Model for Multi-technology Network Interface

Discussion item 1
General update
20 mins

1) Move to LF
   + No major updates wrt last call
   + The call on May 7, dedicated to Github migration, was unsuccessful because we found that promised authorizations were still missing
     - Nigel will contact Michelle for clarifications
	 - POST MEETING NOTE: Nigel got the permissions, we will reschedule the meeting on the next days

   + LF - TIP MoU: Nigel says that Arturo seems favorable to the text as amended by LF, final confirmation is needed


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Discussion item 2
- Spotlight/snapshot stream to "get current data" e.g. on periodical time on selected monitors
40 mins

Nigel presents a slide set with the description of the feature / use case
- Distinction between
  + Event
  + State
  + Analogue value
  
- State may be dependent from Event and/or Analogue value change

- It is necessary to determine which information is valuable
  + A lot of measurements and processings are continuously performed by underlying systems,
    + Producing a potentially huge amount of information
      - where only a small subset is relevant for (immediate) communication (notification, streaming)

- There are also cases where a specific "detail", normally not relevant, becomes of interest
- In general there are three types of collected information:
  1) Upfront data, like alarms, which is vital for the system management
  2) Background data, like performance measurements, for post processing
  3) Live measurement, through either
     - Spotlight (e.g. through an OAM Job with a certain duration), or
	 - Snapshot (e.g. through an instantaneous OAM Job)

- In other words, the snapshot is an extremely short spotlight

- Presented a diagram with:
  + Poll
  + Align & Notify
  + Stream
  
- The snapshot could be supported by:
  + Restconf GET request and reply (when a simple processing is required)
  + Restconf GET request and streaming as reply (when a more complex processing is required)
  
The proposal will develop through some amendments / additions to existing Inventory and OAM use cases
  + Impact on the schema could be minimal
  
Andrea shows the power-measurement-pac which augments the photonic media CEP
  + We need to clarify in the RIA that some attributes of an object may imply a complex processing
    - E.g. propagate the request down to the network device, because it is not locally stored/storable in the server controller
    - Possible solution:
      + GET on the object: all attributes are retrieved which are more stable hence locally stored in the server controller
	  + GET on the object with specific filter: the more variable attribute is retrieved, the filter triggering a more complex process on server side
  + Similar consideration for streaming, only the stable attributes are normally streamed
  + Each network management system may identify the stable / unstable attributes according to its capability
  + Agreed that attempting to isolate the unstable parameters by the schema is an unflexible solution
    - what is considered unstable in system A may be considered stable in system B

 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Discussion item 3
- UC 11a: “Modification of service path” and UML/YANG comments
  + Clarification of connection inclusion/exclusion constraints
60 mins

Andrea shows some slides with examples of:
- Connectivity Service creation with Connection inclusion
  + Connection at the layer or at server layer
- Connectivity Service modification with Connection inclusion
  + Connection at the layer or at server layer
  
Agreed that there are three types of Connection:
1) Connection with intent (i.e. direcly associated to a Connectivity Service)
2) Fixed Connection, by definition not subject of any intent
3) Stranded Connection, which is an abnormal state to be corrected

Preliminary agreement on simpler use case, the inclusion of Connection at server layer
- which is conceptually redundant wrt Link inclusion constraint
  + but we agreed that Link instances are mandatory only at bottom-most layer
  
Discussion to be continued regarding Connection inclusion at the layer
- To be clarified the relationship with the "Connection adoption" use case
  + which is the only one described by UML/YANG comments, since (at least) TAPI version 2.1.3
