Disclaimer:
ONF is disbanding and merging into Linux Foundation.
Until is not fully clarified and agreed under which entity this project will land,
no final decisions will be taken by the TAPI team for the TAPI next versions.
TAPI team will at most agree recommendations, with final agreement postponed.

Discussion item 1
General update
40 mins

1) Move to LF
   + No updates regarding the TR-547/8 copyright
     - No indication if the name will remain TR or something different
   + Agreed to upload the TAPI 2.4.0 blog at Github (2.5.0 draft already present)
   + Nigel and Lyndon have provided the MoU draft to TIP for review
     - Lyndon has forwarded the copy reviewed by TIP to Scott Nicholas at Linux Foundation for final review and approval 
   + Andrea will contact Kam to start planning the publication of TAPI at ITU-T
     - Explore a possible MoU also with ITU-T and MEF

2) 2.5.0 Review: plan for corrections and enhancements
   + Andrea shows the used process for bugs/regressions, applicable to any TAPI delivery:
     1) an issue is opened with the description of the issue
	 2) a patch is drafted
	    - the patches are defined in separate Yang modules, as augments constructs
        - this allows to maintain unaltered the originally delivered Yang modules
   + Issues and patches:
     - https://github.com/OpenNetworkingFoundation/TAPI/issues/568
	   https://github.com/OpenNetworkingFoundation/TAPI/blob/tapi-2_5_0-fixes/TAPI-FIXES/YANG-Patches-Draft/tapi-patch1-photonic-media.yang
	 - https://github.com/OpenNetworkingFoundation/TAPI/issues/569
       https://github.com/OpenNetworkingFoundation/TAPI/blob/tapi-2_5_0-fixes/TAPI-FIXES/YANG-Patches-Draft/tapi-patch1-notification.yang
   + Nigel and Andrea resp. R&Ds approve the patches
   + Esther has presented the TAPI 2.5.0 patches to TIP MUST
     - Esther will inform TAPI team in case a dedicated meeting will be called

 
 3) Proposal to close all issues older than 2023
    + Andrea shows the almost 100 open issues, almost all being pretty old
	  - proposal is to close all issues older than 2023
	  - agreed, but for the issues opened by Service Providers - for further review
	  - the other issues will be closed adding a comment like:
	    + "This issue has been closed due to the lack of activity for more than one year.
		   Please reopen it if follow up is necessary."

Discussion item 2
Photonic Model: fix/update of the transceiver provisioning model
70 mins

Discussed the https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-ccamp-optical-impairment-topology-yang
  - Nigel asks clarification regarding the standard mode, where only G.698.2 is mentioned, while TAPI currently lists:
	+ G.698.1 : Multichannel DWDM applications with single ...
    + G.698.2 : Amplified multichannel dense wavelength ...
    + G.695   : Optical interfaces for coarse wavelength division ...
    + G.696.1 : Longitudinally compatible intra-domain DWDM ...
    + G.959.1 : Optical transport network physical layer interfaces
  - Gabriele replies that G.698.2 is the only one specifying application identifiers
    + Three fundamental types of photonics: CWDM, DWDM, Flex Grid.
	+ Gabriele will verify if the other ITU-T recommendations may be included as further references for standard modes
  - Discussion for clarification of table 8-1 of G.698.2 11/2018
  - Nigel asks why some parameters shall be specified in addition to the reference to a standard mode
	+ a given standard mode should include all the necessary parameters
	+ Esther explains that a vendor may test and publish a profile which is 
	  - compliant to a standard one
	  - while improving some aspects
    + Andrea shows the differences in transceiver profiles between:
      - https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-ccamp-optical-impairment-topology-yang/14/
      - https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-ccamp-optical-impairment-topology-yang/15/
    + Esther indicates that the tx/rx min/max power parameters are associated to the transceiver instance,
	  i.e. these parameters are not / cannot be centralized in a profile
	  - the "explicit profile" being in the "templates" subtree.
  - Further investigation is necessary on draft-ietf-ccamp-optical-impairment-topology before to complete the mapping to TAPI
