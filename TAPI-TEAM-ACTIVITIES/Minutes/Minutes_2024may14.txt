Disclaimer:
ONF is disbanding and merging into Linux Foundation.
Until is not fully clarified and agreed under which entity this project will land,
no final decisions will be taken by the TAPI team for the TAPI next versions.
TAPI team will at most agree recommendations, with final agreement postponed.

Discussion item 1
General update
20 mins

1) Move to LF
   + Successfully migrated the TAPI Github repository under ONMI project
     - https://github.com/Open-Network-Models-and-Interfaces-ONMI/TAPI
   + Planned the review of ONMI landing page, to clarify projects/links
     - https://github.com/Open-Network-Models-and-Interfaces-ONMI/onmi-home

   + LF - TIP MoU: Nigel received Arturo's comments
     - Nigel will close the loop with LF representatives

2) Decision regarding TAPI 2.5.0 blog publishing / testimonials availability
  + Anders suggests that the blog shall be published at TIP level, not only within MUST project
  + Nigel/Andrea shall collect further operator sponsorships


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Discussion item 2
- Node - Device linkage
20 mins

Nigel presents a slide with a proposal to simplify the relationship between Node and Device
  - https://github.com/Open-Network-Models-and-Interfaces-ONMI/TAPI/blob/tapi-team-activities/TAPI-TEAM-ACTIVITIES/Contributions/otcc2024.ND.001_VariousTapiAssociations.pptx
  - Currently the Node/Device relationship can be derived from NEP/Access Port relationship
  - Considering that 
    + this level of flexibility is not always/often necessary
    + more common case is that one Device refers more Nodes, and one Node refers one Device
	it is proposed to add the Node to Device direct relationship
	
  - Roshan asks whether the new relationship is backward compatible
    + Nigel confirms, we are not removing existing NEP-AP relationship, only adding a new relationship for the simpler scenarios


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Discussion item 3
- Navigation IETF <--> TAPI
20 mins

Nigel presents some slides from
  - https://github.com/Open-Network-Models-and-Interfaces-ONMI/TAPI/blob/tapi-team-activities/TAPI-TEAM-ACTIVITIES/Contributions/otcc2024.ND.001_VariousTapiAssociations.pptx
  - It is proposed an
    + extension to RFC8345 as an augmentation maintained by ONF TAPI
      - a reference to "supporting-tapi-cep"
    + extension to TAPI as an augmentation maintained by ONF TAPI
      - list of "client-rfc8345-termination-point"
 
Esther confirms that RFC 8345 foresees both unidirectional and bidirectional links
  - With optical links always considered bidirectional
  
Andrea asks about possible overlapping between modeling entities representing same resource but from different viewpoints
  - IETF already defines augments for L0
  - Nigel clarifies that the proposed solution assumes the complete split of management domains
  

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Discussion item 4
- Spotlight/snapshot stream to "get current data" e.g. on periodical time on selected monitors
30 mins

Nigel presents a slide set with the description of the feature / use case
- https://github.com/Open-Network-Models-and-Interfaces-ONMI/TAPI/blob/tapi-team-activities/TAPI-TEAM-ACTIVITIES/Contributions/otcc2024.ND.002_SpotlightAndSnapshotStreams.pptx
- Spotlight stream, using gNMI/Protobuf format
- The OAM Job driving the snapshot and spotlight measurements
- Outstanding: How to model a property in an entity that can be acquired via snapshot/spotlight but that should not be read on get and should not be notified/streamed normally?
  + Last week we considered the 
    - GET on the object: all attributes are retrieved which are more stable hence locally stored in the server controller
	- GET on the object with specific filter: the more variable attribute is retrieved, the filter triggering a more complex process on server side


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Discussion item 5
- UC 11a: “Modification of service path” and UML/YANG comments
  + Clarification of connection inclusion/exclusion constraints
30 mins

Andrea shows some slides updated according to last week discussions, below the reviewed text:
- Connectivity Service Creation
  + Include same layer Connection
    - Connection with intent not considered
    - Fixed Connection
      + Included in the Connection hierarchy, to inform about the relationship with a service
    - Stranded Connection
      + If fully covering the intent, adopting it by the intent
      + If partially covering the intent, disappearing as being merged in the newly created Connection with intent
        - In order to be merged, the stranded connection must be fully consistent with intent

  + Include server layer Connection, of any type
    - Must already support the proper virtual network
    - Will become part of the Connection hierarchy

- Connectivity Service Modification
  + Include same layer Connection: same as creation scenario
  + Include server layer Connection, of any type: same as creation scenario
  + In all cases, zero, one or more existing server Connections may be released
    - Released Connections may be deleted or moved to stranded state, up to local policy.

Nigel suggests that we may add the use case of forcing the deletion of a stranded connection if in conflict with an intent
  - For further discussion
