Discussion item 1
General update
20 mins

1) 2.5.0 OAS issues
     - The amended OAS modules are available in the "develop" branch:
       https://github.com/OpenNetworkingFoundation/TAPI/tree/develop

2) Move to LF
     - Gabriele: does LF believe in OTCC/TAPI?
     - Which could be the impact of enthusiasm of our customers? Is Telefonica concerned?
     - Nigel: three years ago would have been worrying, now the criticality of TAPI is well recognized, e.g. thanks to TIP support.
     - TST members asked for a call with ONF and possibly LF representatives, to explore the possible migration.
       + The email titled "ONF Status Update - List of questions" has been circulated among TST members, Andrea will forward to TAPI attendees.

3) Blog for version 2.5.0
     - On hold due to ONF disbanding
