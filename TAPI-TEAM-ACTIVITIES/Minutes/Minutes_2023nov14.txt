Discussion item 1
How to recover our activities from the loss of ONF wiki
Starting from the plan and contributions
40 mins

Andrea and Nigel explain what happened to ONF wiki.
So far the last year of all minutes, plans , track of contributions seem lost.
Nigel has investigated with Arturo whether TIP may (temporarily) host our work. Option postponed because TIP is going to change platform, with December scheduled as blackout month.

Andrea shows the new TAPI branch defined in Github, with the purpose to (temporarily?) replace ONF wiki.
- https://github.com/OpenNetworkingFoundation/TAPI/tree/tapi-team-activities

The TAPI-TEAM-ACTIVITIES directory includes the following subdirectories:
- Contributions (all authors are invited to resend their contributions)
- Minutes
- Plan
- RIA (where to find the TR-547/548 documents and other ancillary docs)

Nigel and Andrea are trying to recover the TAPI plans.
Andrea shows the first draft of paln for TAPI 2.6.0, updated during the meeting.

Jonathan proposes to discuss the following items at next TAPI call:
- Opt impairments --> Eqp model, see OIF 2023.422
- Path comp --> Path as routing constraint, see OIF 2023.436

Discussion item 2
RPC vs. Data API discussion
30 mins

Andrea and Nigel recap the discussion with Orange.

The Restconf implementation of OpenDaylight (hence TransportPCE) provides a direct API access to the datastore.
While this behavior is in line with Restconf, the TAPI provisioning implies more complex transactions.
In general, the data associated to a TAPI provisioning (creation, modification, deletion) represents the intent for such provisioning, which triggers a (potentially very complex) process in the server controller. This process may involve both internal and network modifications, their synchronization, etc.

The decision to deprecate RPCs from TAPI was due:
- the complexity of design and maintenance
- the separation of TAPI data structures dedicated to intent from the data structures dedicated to the mirroring of system state (controllers, network).
The POST/PUT/DELETE intents trigger processes which lead to orchestrated changes of the system state, these changes occurring in a variable amount of time, from seconds to hours or even more for e.g. scheduled activities. TAPI model specifies the data structures, TAPI RIAs specify how to use them for a number of Use Cases.

Nigel recalls that at IETF the evolutions ("next") of Netconf, Restconf and Yang are under discussion, references being:

- https://github.com/netconf-wg/restconf-next/issues
- https://github.com/netconf-wg/restconf-next/issues
- https://github.com/netmod-wg/yang-next/issues

Furthermore last week (at IETF 118 Prague) the concept of "candidate intent" has been informally discussed, with the target to add the item to the "next" todo list.

Agreed to add a discussion page re RPCs/Data API/Intent to TAPI
