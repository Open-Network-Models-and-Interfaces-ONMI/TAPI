Disclaimer:
ONF is disbanding and merging into Linux Foundation.
Until is not fully clarified and agreed under which entity this project will land,
no final decisions will be taken by the TAPI team for the TAPI next versions.
TAPI team will at most agree recommendations, with final agreement postponed.

Discussion item 1
General update
60 mins

1) Move to LF
   + LF provided the draft of a MOU
     - Nigel: the candidate SDOs are TIP and OIF
     - Nigel: to be clarified how to fill the "Intended Area of Collaboration" of the MOU
   + Agreed that TAPI YANG will continue with Apache 2.0
   + Still under discussion the copyright of TR-547 and TR-548
   + Still no move of ONF Github repository
     - Agreed to solicit LF

2) Update on multi-SDO harmonization of Photonic Metrics
   + Nigel outlines the harmonization activity taking place in IETF
     - Focus is significally but not exclusively the plugs
     - Gathering and rationalization of the photonic metrics, currently defined across several SDOs
       + IETF CCAMP, ITU-T, OIF-CMIS, OpenConfig, TAPI
     - To define which is the appropriate list of properties, to be incorporated in IETF and TAPI.
     - Opportunity is that the involved models are there but also relatively recent,
       hence improvements for consistency are likely not affecting a large implemented base.

3) Update on Problem / Incident API
   + Nigel presents this work, currently ongoing in IETF, which outcomes can be adopted by TAPI.
   + References are
     - https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-feng-opsawg-incident-management/
     - https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-davis-nmop-incident-terminology/

4)  Outline a 2.5.1 delivery or early 2.6.0?
    + Andrea indicates that the ongoing review of version 2.5.0 is highlighting bugs and need for rapid improvements.
    + After a brief discussion, agreed that Andrea will present a snapshot of candidate modifications
      - in support of the evaluation of a 2.5.1 or a 2.6.0 next step.
    + Nigel recalls that TIP MUST has selected TAPI 2.5.0 as its reference version
      - Anders suggests that the evaluation shall be brought back to MUST.

Discussion item 2
Photonic Model: fix the transceiver provisioning model
20 mins

Andrea shows the IETF drafts he is parsing to update TAPI
- Gabriele and Esther clarify that
  + The reference for transceiver capability and state models is
    - https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-ccamp-optical-impairment-topology-yang/
  + The reference for transceiver configuration model is
    - https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-ccamp-dwdm-if-param-yang/10/
      + specifically the structure "provisioning-opt-if-och-mode-params"
  + The common library of data types is
    - https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-ccamp-rfc9093-bis/
  + With a warning that "optical-impairment-topology-yang" is more advanced wrt "wdm-if-param-yang"
    regarding overlapping definitions

- Andrea will review the indicated IETF drafts, for inclusion in TAPI
  + and provide feedback to Gabriele as necessary


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Discussion item 3
Continue the discussion on digital payload of photonic media
40 mins

Andrea recalls that so far the TAPI RIA has foreseen transponder to transponder connectivity config/state model optimized to G.709 OTN payload.
- This could be a limitation, given the variety of existing solutions, e.g.
  + OTN but not G.709
  + Non OTN

- Andrea shows the slide with the requirements for "transponder to transponder" Connectivity Service
  + Text amended according to suggestions from the team

- Discussion to be continued.
