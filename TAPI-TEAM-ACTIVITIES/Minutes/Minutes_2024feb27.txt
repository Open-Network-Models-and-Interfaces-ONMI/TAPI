Discussion item 1
General update
30 mins

1) Move to LF
   + LF has recently confirmed that they will provide, without costs
     - Conference call platform and Github repository
   + Nigel recalls that the challenge is still the TR-547/8 copyright
     - TRs are used by TIP MUST to allow max interoperability
     - TRs are currently stored in an Apache 2.0 repository, but without any Apache statement in the documents
   + Nigel and Lyndon are preparing a draft for the MoU with TIP regarding the TRs
     - to formalize the TIP strong influence on TAPI TRs
     - defending and protecting from the overly liberal environment of LF
   + Andrea will contact Kam to start planning the publication of TAPI at ITU-T

2) Update on multi-SDO harmonization of Photonic Metrics
   + Nigel outlines the harmonization activity taking place in IETF
     - This activity originates from IETF work on pluggable (use cases and parameters)
     - See https://github.com/italobusi/actn-wdm-pluggable-modelling
   + Nigel will keep TAPI team updated

Discussion item 2
Review contribution
  + https://github.com/OpenNetworkingFoundation/TAPI/blob/tapi-team-activities/TAPI-TEAM-ACTIVITIES/Contributions/TAPI_2.5.0_Review_26_02_2024.pptx
45 mins

Andrea presents the slides
  - the ongoing review of version 2.5.0 is highlighting bugs and need for rapid improvements
  - so far two regressions have been found, more urgent to be solved
    + through a TAPI 2.5.0 Release Note, recommending how to patch (e.g. name/value pairs etc.)
    + Roshan asks to check if regressions affect also 2.4.0/1 versions (answer is yes).
  - Other enhancements are presented
    + some only affecting the RIA, with OTSiMCA Connectivity Service as top priority
  - Nigel: the enhancements for not yet defined UCs could be left as proprietary ones
  - Agreed to prepare for the next week a proposal for the plan of corrections/enhancements
    + Anders will bring back the plan to MUST, for evaluation.

Discussion item 3
Photonic Model: fix/update of the transceiver provisioning model
45 mins

Andrea shows the updated UML diagrams
- Andrea asks for a clarification regarding the comment of in-band-osnr "measured at reference point Ss"
  + Esther and Gabriele indicate that
    - "measured at reference point Ss" is to be intended as
    - "measured at transmission point", reference being G.698.2
    - It is the quality of the transceiver regarding the inserted noise, in trasmission
- Andrea asks for clarification regarding OSNR and Penalty unit of measurements
  + Esther confirms that, as defined by the IETF draft
    - the OSNR is "measured over 0.1 nm resolution bandwidth"
    - the Penalty is measured in pure dB, as it is a ratio applied to the OSNR
- Ronald suggests to consider the provisioning of the frequency offset, or drift
  + indicated the reference: IA OIF-C-CMIS-01.1 Table 7
  + for further discussion
