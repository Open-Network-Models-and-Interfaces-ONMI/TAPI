TAPI team will at most agree recommendations, with final agreement postponed.

Discussion item 1
General update
30 mins

1) Move to LF
   + No updates regarding the TR-547/8 copyright
     - No indication if the name will remain TR or something different
   + Andrea will contact Kam to start planning the publication of TAPI at ITU-T
     - Explore a possible MoU also with ITU-T and MEF
   + Andrea shows the new link to ONMI Project from https://www.linuxfoundation.org/projects
     - Now ONMI is a LF project!
   + Lyndon was told about eventually using PCC as a platform for mailing lists
     - Jonathan found a description as a LF pre-release platform for LF projects: https://docs.linuxfoundation.org/v2/project-control-center-pcc-pre-release  
   + Lyndon has distributed the draft of TIP MoU, with Scott Nicholas’ comments (TIP - LF MOU 3-29-2024)
   + Lyndon also distributed the summary of LF proposals regarding ONMI project future (ONMIProjectFuture_3april2024)
     - Both contributions are available in https://github.com/OpenNetworkingFoundation/TAPI/tree/tapi-team-activities/TAPI-TEAM-ACTIVITIES/Contributions
   + Jonathan recalls that Lyndon is leaving Ciena, his role being moved to Nigel
     - Lyndon may anyway continue to collaborate


2) 2.5.1 Review and final approval
   + Andrea shows the draft 2.5.1 release based on
	 - https://github.com/OpenNetworkingFoundation/TAPI/tree/tapi-2_5_0-fixes
   + Proposal is agreed - Andrea will deliver 2.5.1
   + Esther confirms the general agreement in TIP MUST regarding TAPI 2.5.1 for patches

Discussion item 2
Photonic Model: fix/update of the transceiver provisioning model
30 mins

Andrea shows slides regarding the model of transceiver
- capabilities
- provisioning (intent)
- configuration (result of the intent)

Esther and Gabriele provide some clarifications:
- the instance related data structure is useful when the capabilities are context sensitive
  + e.g. the capabilitity of a pluggable (identified by a part number) may change depending on where it is installed
- the capability description granularity is on single transceiver, which in CCAMP is defined as a topological item
  + while in TAPI the logical model item representing the transceiver function is the OTSiMC CEP
    - which does not exist until involved in a Connection
- Andrea will adapt the model proposal according to the above clarifications.

Jonathan: the draft-ietf-ccamp-optical-impairment-topology-yang-15 is assuming a GOSNR (Generalized OSNR) approach, which is only valid to uncompensated coherent networks.
-  It does not allow for OOK interferers such as 10G or non-coherent 40G.
-  To accommodate those signals, the network needs to provide XPM/SPM/4WM parameters to compute the cross-talk.
-  Lets continue the discussion on next week’s call.
