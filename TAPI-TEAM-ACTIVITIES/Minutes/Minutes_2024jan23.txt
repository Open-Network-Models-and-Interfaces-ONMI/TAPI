Discussion item 1
General update
10 mins

1) Move to LF
     - Andrea briefly recalls that ONF will disappear at the end of the month.
     - OTCC/OIMT TST still evaluating ownerships and other relevant aspects of the new affiliation.

2) Error in Photonic Media Model
     - Andrea informs that an error has been found in the Photonic Media Model, the transceiver provisioning is missing two (key) parameters.
     - Corrective actions still to be evaluated.

Discussion item 2
Path computation: Path as routing constraint
50 mins

Jonathan announces a contribution regarding path computation use cases. To be reviewed on next call.
- Mentioned that connection and path computation will be key subjects for OFC 2025.

Andrea shows a draft document with a summary of the augments defined in draft-ietf-teas-yang-path-computation-21.txt:
- https://github.com/OpenNetworkingFoundation/TAPI/blob/tapi-team-activities/TAPI-TEAM-ACTIVITIES/Contributions/ietfCcampTeasPathComp_am23012024.txt
- Next step: start updating the TAPI model, at least the Connectivity Service constraints.
  Regarding TAPI Path Computation, we still miss the related use cases.

- Esther clarifies that the path computation is expected to be performed considering the end of life of network resources.
  + In other words, the computed path shall be fulfilling the specified constraints during the whole network lifecycle.
    Penalties (e.g. increasing crosstalk) shall be calculated in this future proof perspective.

- Jonathan points out that the "gsnr" constraint is not enough.
  + Esther agrees, "gsnr" is a starting point, contributions are welcome.

- Discussion on multi-domain path constraints.
  + General agreement that:
    - Today the ENNI always foresees the O/E/O.
    - The orchestrator (managing more domains) shall be provided with full details regarding topology and impairments,
      otherwise if each domain controller provides only an abstract picture, then there is the risk of cranckback.
    - Gabriele: each domain may make available different (or same but differently evaluated) parameters, leading to sub-optimal solutions.
      Andrea: we are here exactly to minimize the unnecessary differences.
  + Jonathan mentions the need to know the power level of signal coming from the other domain, and that computation shall specify spectrum rather than frequencies.
