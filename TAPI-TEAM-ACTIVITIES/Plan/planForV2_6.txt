Note that:
- All features and enhancements should start with business scenarios and/or use cases along with requirements. 
  + These may initially be lightweight and be developed as the solution is developed
- For a feature/enhancement to be completed, the necessary UML, Yang, RIA etc. changes/additions must be provided by the team. 
- Where a feature is being delivered over multiple releases, it is an option to deliver draft Use Cases and model in the first one or two release(s).
- Effort should be made to achieve backward compatibility with previous releases.
