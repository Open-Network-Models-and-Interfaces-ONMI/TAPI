Feature priority for TAPI 2.6.0 (6 - 8 months)

- Further developments of Photonic OAM (Andrea Mazzini)

- Complex digital payload of photonic media (Andrea Mazzini)
  + Describe how a DSR (perhaps directly supporting IP) can be carried directly by photonics 
  + OTSiG on multiple line ports

- Staged provisioning of Connectivity Service (lifecycle state) (Andrea Mazzini)

- ZR/ZR+ Use Cases

- 3R Scenarios (not fully covered at this stage)
  + Further development of Connectivity UCs including 3R
  + In relationship with Asymmetric Service model
  + In relationship to Resiliency
  + See IETF related works

- RESTCONF Response codes for use cases

- Security: identity, authentication, authorization, confidentiality, etc. (STRIDE) 
  + TLS, SSH
  + NACM

- Further development of Optical Impairments UCs (Esther)
  + Work ongoing @ IETF

- Development of Path Computation UCs
  + Connectivity Service related to computation service

- Node to Device relationship

- Linkage between TAPI model and IETF model to allow navigation from photonic/OTN to IP layers
  + Initially e.g. minimal navigation capability (RFC 8345, RFC 8795)

- All properties are conditional

- PM streaming enhancements
  + Validate that the PM streaming model aligns with the most recent moves in oam
  + Additional properties in enums
  + Zero and same value suppression

- Improve documentation on POST/DELETE

- Problem / Incident reporting (elementary fault analysis / synthesis)
  + some work ongoing @ IETF




Note that:
- All features and enhancements should start with business scenarios and/or use cases along with requirements. 
  + These may initially be lightweight and be developed as the solution is developed
- For a feature/enhancement to be completed, the necessary UML, Yang, RIA etc. changes/additions must be provided by the team. 
- Where a feature is being delivered over multiple releases, it is an option to deliver draft Use Cases and model in the first one or two release(s).
- Effort should be made to achieve backward compatibility with previous releases.
