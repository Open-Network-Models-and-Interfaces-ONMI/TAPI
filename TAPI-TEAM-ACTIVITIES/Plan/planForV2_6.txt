Feature priority for TAPI 2.6.0 (6 - 8 months)

Topology Management
  1) UNI/ENNI: deprecation of DSR and OTN as layer names for UNI/ENNI SIP/NEP
     - For both fixed and configurable UNI/ENNI use instead either PHOTONIC_MEDIA or (new) ELECTRICAL_MEDIA

Connectivity Management
  1) Staged provisioning of Connectivity Service (lifecycle state) (Andrea)
     - Including schedule / temporal management
  2) Development of Path Computation UCs (Nigel)
     - Connectivity Service related to computation service
     - Connectivity Service constraints on PathSet (e.g. inclusion)
  3) Review of SIP capability model regarding the potentially supported CSEPs
     - A given SIP instance may potentially support services at more layers

Photonic Connectivity Management
  1) Complex digital payload of photonic media (Andrea)
     - Describe how a DSR (perhaps directly supporting IP) can be carried directly by photonics 
     - OTSiG on multiple line ports
  2) Remote Pluggable (e.g. ZR/ZR+) Use Cases (Nigel)
     - Consider OIF for the pluggable model
  3) 3R Scenarios
     - Further development of Connectivity UCs including 3R
     - In relationship with Asymmetric Service model
     - In relationship to Resiliency
     - See IETF related works (https://github.com/ietf-ccamp-wg/draft-ietf-ccamp-optical-impairment-topology-yang)
  4) Linkage between TAPI model and IETF model to allow navigation from photonic/OTN to IP layers
     - Initially e.g. minimal navigation capability (RFC 8345, RFC 8795)

OAM Management
  1) Problem / Incident reporting (elementary fault analysis / synthesis) (Nigel)
     - Some work ongoing @ IETF
  2) PM streaming enhancements (Nigel)
     - Validate that the PM streaming model aligns with the most recent moves in oam
     - Additional properties in enums
     - Zero and same value suppression
     - Snapshot stream to "get current data"
     - fix to some strings in the protobuf data (not in correct case) - note that this will not impact compatibility.

Photonic OAM Management
  1) Further development of Optical Impairments UCs (Esther)
     - Work ongoing @ IETF
  2) Further developments of Photonic OAM model (Andrea)

Equipment Management
  1) Node to Device relationship (Nigel)

RESTCONF
  1) Response codes for use cases
  2) Improve documentation on POST/DELETE (Nigel)
     - Following the removal of all RPCs

General applications
  1) All properties are conditional
  2) Security: identity, authentication, authorization, confidentiality, etc. (STRIDE) 
     - TLS, SSH
     - NACM


Note that:
- All features and enhancements should start with business scenarios and/or use cases along with requirements. 
  + These may initially be lightweight and be developed as the solution is developed
- For a feature/enhancement to be completed, the necessary UML, Yang, RIA etc. changes/additions must be provided by the team. 
- Where a feature is being delivered over multiple releases, it is an option to deliver draft Use Cases and model in the first one or two release(s).
- Effort should be made to achieve backward compatibility with previous releases.
