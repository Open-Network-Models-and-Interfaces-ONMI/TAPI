Feature priority for TAPI > 2.6.0

- Multiband management extensions
- Event notifications, correlation of events (e.g. when an active alarm changes its severity)
- Linkage between TAPI model and IETF model to allow navigation from photonic/OTN to IP layers
  + Initially e.g. minimal navigation capability (RFC 8345, RFC 8795)
- Quality, e.g. add descriptions to UML - Technology specific modules.
- Quality: Check & sanitize the shared aggregation associations, which adds a lifecycle dependency to a class
- Consider introduction of Administrative State for physical context objects. 
- Consider also more general subject of state propagation behavior.



Note that:
- All features and enhancements should start with business scenarios and/or use cases along with requirements. 
  + These may initially be lightweight and be developed as the solution is developed
- For a feature/enhancement to be completed, the necessary UML, Yang, RIA etc. changes/additions must be provided by the team. 
- Where a feature is being delivered over multiple releases, it is an option to deliver draft Use Cases and model in the first one or two release(s).
- Effort should be made to achieve backward compatibility with previous releases.
