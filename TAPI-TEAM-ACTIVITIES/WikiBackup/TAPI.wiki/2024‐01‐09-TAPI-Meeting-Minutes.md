General update

20 mins

1) Delivery of corrected OAS modules
     - The amended OAS modules are available here:
       https://github.com/OpenNetworkingFoundation/TAPI/tree/tapi-team-activities/TAPI-TEAM-ACTIVITIES/RIA/Ancillary/OAS_250_Corrected
     - A warning has been added to the v2.5.0 release page:

2) Move to LF
     - Nigel provides an update
       + The next hour the ONF leadership will present the transition to LF
         (Post meeting note: no relevant news for OIMT/OTCC --> ONMI)
       + LF representative has scheduled another call next week (Thu 18 - "Launching ONMI @ LF")
       + LF seems an unstructured container for around 1000 projects.
         - Apparently some projects are federating "bottom-up", of our interest could be the LF Networking group
           https://lfnetworking.org/
     - Esther asks whether TIP MUST is aware of ONF disbanding
       + Nigel has contacted Arturo before the holidays, will check
     - Andrea is contacting Nokia colleagues already active in LF Networking
