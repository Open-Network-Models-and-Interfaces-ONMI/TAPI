How to recover our activities from the loss of ONF wiki

Starting from the plan and contributions

40 mins

Andrea and Nigel explain what happened to ONF wiki.
So far the last year of all minutes, plans , track of contributions seem lost.
Nigel has investigated with Arturo whether TIP may (temporarily) host our work. Option postponed because TIP is going to change platform, with December scheduled as blackout month.

Andrea shows the new TAPI branch defined in Github, with the purpose to (temporarily?) replace ONF wiki.
- https://github.com/OpenNetworkingFoundation/TAPI/tree/tapi-team-activities

The TAPI-TEAM-ACTIVITIES directory includes the following subdirectories:
- Contributions (all authors are invited to resend their contributions)
- Minutes
- Plan
- RIA (where to find the TR-547/548 documents and other ancillary docs)

Nigel and Andrea are trying to recover the TAPI plans.
Andrea shows the first draft of paln for TAPI 2.6.0, updated during the meeting.

Jonathan proposes to discuss the following items at next TAPI call:
- Opt impairments --> Eqp model, see OIF 2023.422
- Path comp --> Path as routing constraint, see OIF 2023.436
