1) Move to LF
   + No updates regarding the TR-547/8 copyright
     - No indication if the name will remain TR or something different
   + Andrea will contact Kam to start planning the publication of TAPI at ITU-T
     - Explore a possible MoU also with ITU-T and MEF
   + TIP - LF MoU
     - Nigel, we need to clarify with Scott Nicholas that we are not overcommitting with TIP, rather maintaining the previous level of commitment.
   + ONMI TST
     - agreed to contact some
	   + current members to check if they are still interested and willing to contribute
	   + candidate new members (e.g. Esther and Jonathan)
	     - major role being the TAPI release approval
