**Discussion item 1**

General update

30 mins

1) Move to LF
   + LF has recently confirmed that they will provide, without costs
     - Conference call platform and Github repository
   + Nigel recalls that the challenge is still the TR-547/8 copyright
     - TRs are used by TIP MUST to allow max interoperability
     - TRs are currently stored in an Apache 2.0 repository, but without any Apache statement in the documents
   + Nigel and Lyndon are preparing a draft for the MoU with TIP regarding the TRs
     - to formalize the TIP strong influence on TAPI TRs
     - defending and protecting from the overly liberal environment of LF
   + Andrea will contact Kam to start planning the publication of TAPI at ITU-T

2) Update on multi-SDO harmonization of Photonic Metrics
   + Nigel outlines the harmonization activity taking place in IETF
     - This activity originates from IETF work on pluggable (use cases and parameters)
     - See https://github.com/italobusi/actn-wdm-pluggable-modelling
   + Nigel will keep TAPI team updated
