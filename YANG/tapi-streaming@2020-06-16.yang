        - Status of YANG model artifacts can be determined by referring to the corresponding UML artifacts.
        As described in the UML models, some artifacts are considered *experimental*, and thus the corresponding YANG artifacts.
        - The ONF TAPI release process does not guarantee backward compatibility of YANG models across major versions of TAPI releases.
        The YANG model backward compatibility criteria are outlined in section 11 of <https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7950__;!!OSsGDw!bx-l35NqfQHpJ8R_DmXfi2NX2ll5dMl9VbK5aS_m3ZShiVoz74Ur_zcAY1P4$ >.
        YANG models included in this release may not be backward compatible with previous TAPI releases.

                Lamps can only be on or off, and bells sounding or not sounding, so alarms were Boolean in nature.
                Where a detector was essentially multi-state it was converted into multiple Boolean statements.
                The management of the equipments was essentially human only and local only (there were rarely remote systems).
                The device with the problem was the only possible indicator of importance and it had only three distinct bulbs to illuminate (filament bulbs tend to fail requiring costly replacement).
                The devices were relatively simple in function and analysis of the detectors was crude.
                There was only the device to indicate severity
                The device also could provide the best view as to whether a service was impacted, although clearly it had almost no knowledge.
                In a modern solution with well-connected remote systems that increasingly analyze problems and where there is increasingly 'lights out' building operation, the device's guess at severity etc. is irrelevant.
                In addition, with sophisticated resilience mechanisms, the device cannot make any relevant statement on whether the customer service has been impacted.
                Likewise, in a world where there were no remote systems and local management was the only practice, alarms had to be locally 'acknowledged'. 
                Where there are remote systems, per alarm acknowledge is burdensome.
                However, many solutions and operational practices continue to use the historic schemes.
