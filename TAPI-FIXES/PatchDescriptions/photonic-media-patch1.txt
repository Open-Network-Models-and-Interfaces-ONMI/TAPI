Title: Missing parameters from photonic CSEP and CEP
Type: Regression

This patch allows to augment Photonic CSEP and CEP with the augments of version 2.1.3
It is recommended to NOT use these augments of version 2.5.0: otsia-connectivity-service-end-point-spec, otsi-mc-connection-end-point-spec, mc-connection-end-point-spec
It is recommended to use instead the augments defined in tapi-photonic-media-patch1.yang/tree
